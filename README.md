# My Azure Blob Manager

## A simple Azure Blob Manager for managing your Azure Blobs.  Currently supports upload, download, view, delete, and list operations.

### This is a work in progress. I am still working on the documentation and the code.  thanks 

To setup your blob connection string, you need to create an environment variable in windows with this name:

AzureBlobConnectionString

And set the value to your Azure Blob connection string.  You can find this in the Azure Portal under your storage account.

Otherwise you will have to go into settings dialog and reset the connection string manually every time you run the app.
